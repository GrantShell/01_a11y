## Website for the SEO Marketing company Horiseon Marketing Agency

Horiseon first wanted to have a website that had cleaner code. They also wanted to have the website be more accessible for people with disabilities. I was able to make the code flow better along with making it easier for others to work on in the future.
Making sure the nav bar was able to jump to the correct locations was important. along with adding in Alt tags allows for access for more accessability for others and if it does not load as well. Along with making the contrast better just helps the over all look of the site.
